# Optimization-Based Scheduling for Agile Earth-Observing Satellite Constellations

This repository contains the first stage implementation of a two-step binary linear programming method designed to optimize task scheduling within a constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites. Leveraging a standard mixed-integer linear programming solver, this method allocates tasks among satellites to maximize the overall mission performance metric, considering optimal task starting times and satellite-ground station communication intervals


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This code has been tested with Python 3.8. Additionally, you will need to install the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `PuLP`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas pulp
```
